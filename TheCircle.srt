00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:04,426
Mr Thoma, you are
Sales Engineer for Voice Alarm Systems

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:05,827
at Siemens for Switzerland.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,444
What would a layman make of your job title?

4
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:12,558
Security in a public building
is a big aspect.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,430
In a restaurant
like the one here in Leon's Loft

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,435
We have a voice alert.

7
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,458
People are given guidance by loudspeakers,

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,060
and in the event of an incident
they can simply leave the building.

9
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:31,050
What kind of events can occur to enable an
evacuation?

10
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,018
The following events can occur,

11
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:40,131
such as a bomb alarm, fire alarm, 
building alarm, or environmental alarm.

12
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,935
There are a lot of possibilities.

13
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:46,337
What needs to be taken into account when
evacuating buildings in general?

14
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,457
The important thing is to reach out and
reassure people,

15
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:53,481
so that people will follow the instructions
given by the speakers.

16
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:57,140
This way no major complications can
arise.

17
00:00:57,527 --> 00:01:00,423
What is the role of voice evacuation

18
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,851
during evacuations ?

19
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:06,954
Voice evacuation, as opposed to
other siren systems,

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,348
is there to guide people.

21
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:12,587
In the event of an incident, they can now
rescue themselves relatively quickly

22
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,010
without causing any major damage.

23
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,627
Which products from your range

24
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,917
have you installed here in
Leon's Loft restaurant?

25
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:24,614
Here in Leons Loft we have installed our
Nivogo amplifiers,

26
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,081
two 250 watt amplifiers.

27
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,229
In addition, we have installed large
speakers and regulators,

28
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,407
i.e. volume controls.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,741
This was very important to the customer

30
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:38,676
as he demanded increased quality.

31
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,789
What products have you
installed in The Circle?

32
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:46,014
We installed the Novigo system
in The Circle.

33
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:50,126
We have installed Siemens speakers
for the basic set-up

34
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,939
and for the tenant set-up we have
installed combined branded speakers.

35
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,257
What are the functions of the brand
loudspeakers?

36
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,167
The branded speakers perform two
functions -

37
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,806
better intelligibility and
voice quality

38
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,074
and also background music.

39
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,763
What was special about this 'The
Circle' project for you personally?

40
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,156
The size of the project.

41
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:20,900
We have interconnected around 80 Novigo
central units here,

42
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:27,518
that is, we can stream streaming services
and radio stations or radio programmes

43
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,848
in the network

44
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,456
and each tenant has the opportunity

45
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,308
to choose their own programme here.

46
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:40,344
What advantages do your products offer
over those of your competitors?

47
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:43,698
Our products, such as the control panels 
and the controls

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,300
are easily networkable with
normal internet cables.

49
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:51,692
What challenges did you have to overcome
here in The Circle

50
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:53,770
and how did you solve them, Mr. Thoma?

51
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:57,365
Yes, the size was a big challenge,
of course,

52
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:00,738
as was the delivery of the products.

53
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,257
We could only have our products delivered

54
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:06,568
here at a certain time slot.

55
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:12,594
In addition, there were constant changes 
to the floor plan or rents.

56
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:15,510
It wasn't all that simple.

57
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:18,763
But we are very proud of our employees

58
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:21,883
who have done a fantastic job here.
